Description: Go support for Protocol Buffers (second major revision)
 This project hosts the Go implementation for protocol buffers, which
 is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for
 serializing structured data.
 The protocol buffer language is a language for specifying the
 schema for structured data.
 .
 This schema is compiled into language specific bindings.
 .
 This project provides both a tool to generate Go code for the
 protocol buffer language, and also the runtime implementation to
 handle serialization of messages in Go.

Description: Go support for Protocol Buffers (protoc compiler plugin)
 It augments the protoc compiler so that it knows how to generate Go
 specific code for a given .proto file.
 .
 This plugin is provided google.golang.org/protobuf module, aka the
 second major revision of the Go protocol buffer API.  Compared to
 the old protoc-gen-go plugin (in golang-goprotobuf-dev package)
 provided by github.com/golang/protobuf module, it doesn't support
 generating gRPC service definitions.
